    As a student at NU, I've had a wide array of opportunities to
    build my programming skills and apply those skills in production
    environments. My biggests interests are in Full-Stack web
    development, firmware development for embedded systems, and
    database design and administration. I pride myself on clean,
    maintainable code and an eye for beautiful UIs. I thrive in
    collaborative environments, being a member of the KTP Tech
    Professional Fraternity and a team mentor in the LAUNCH
    Entrepreneurship Program. Iâ€™m currently working at the Querrey
    Simpson Institute for Bioelectronics to develop firmware for
    implantable sensors for the healthcare industry
